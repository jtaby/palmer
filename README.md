This book is intended to serve as a companion to The Palmer Method of Business Writing Book by A. N. Palmer. It’s important to read the introduction in order to build a solid foundation of posture and mechanics.

This book also omits certain passages from the drill descriptions which are important. The text accompa- nying the drill is intended to be a reference, not a sub- stitute for reading the book thoroughly & carefully.

Some drills have an * after the number. These are critical drills that must be practiced at the beginning of each session until you’ve mastered the Palmer Method. These critical drills are repeated in a more condensed form at the end of the book for efficient printing before each practice session.

The count and timing of each drill is provided and should be followed. Business writing without pacing and timing will not lead to successful results.

The drills are intended to be used in three different phases:

The first sixty drills are intended to be either traced over or practice in-place for quick reference. You should print copies of these pages repeatedly as you practice. Practicing on this paper will make compar- ing your writing to the samples easier and faster.

Drills sixty-one to one hundred and seven are better practiced on the worksheets, since they require more space and repetition.

The remaining drills thereafter should be practiced entirely on separate practice paper, since each drill requires a full page of practice.

At the end of the book, there are printable lined sheets with the proper spacing for Palmer script, at two slants. When printing, choose to print however many copies you like, at the slant you prefer.

The practice lines in the drills are dark, to help you focus on spacing. The lines in the worksheets at the end are lighter, to help focus on the writing material.

The lines provided are according to the descriptions in the text. The base lines are 3/8th of an inch apart, and the x-height is 1/16th of an inch.
